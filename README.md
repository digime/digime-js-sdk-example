# digime-js-sdk-example

---
## Preparation
In order to run this example app, you'll need to perform some preparation steps:

#### Obtain the following from digi.me:
* Contract ID
* Application ID
* Private key (PKCS1 PEM)
* Depending on which consent mode you run, you may need a valid iOS/Android client application on your phone, with a library created on it ([See below for more info](#setting-up-the-digi.me-library))

#### On the machine that will run the example:
* Node version 8.6 or greater, with NPM
* git (optional)

## Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/digime/digime-js-sdk-example/archive/sdk.zip) and extract, or clone the `sdk` branch on this repo with the following command:

    `git clone --single-branch -b sdk git@github.com:digime/digime-js-sdk-example.git`

2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned/extracted this example (If you see this README in it, you're in the correct place!)

3. Run `npm install` in your terminal

4. Open the `index.js` file in your favourite code editor, and replace or adjust environment variable with values you received from digi.me (described in code comments as well).

5. Run `npm start` in your terminal

    This should print out something along these lines:

    ```Example app now running on:
    - http://localhost:8081
    - http://192.168.0.10:8081 (probably)
    ```



6. You should now be able to access the example app ðŸŽ‰:
    - First URL should be able to be opened on the same machine you started the server (So you can be sure it's running)
    - The second URL is our best guess as to what your local network IP is. You should be able to open the example app from your phone with it, assuming that both machines are on the same network.

## Additional information

### Two user consent flows

There are two ways for users to give consent to your digi.me library:
A. Using digi.me mobile apps (recommended) - You need to have an Android or iOS device with the digi.me client installed. Currently, you will need a special build that digi.me can provide. Install the digi.me client and create a library with some data that we can share. If you would like a pre-populated library, you can connect to one of our existing libraries, please contact digi.me for details.
B. Guest consent (demo) - We can offer a guest consent flow which asks for the user data from the browser. As part of this flow, the users will need to go through the adding of services to provide the data to be shared to your application. When the user data is ready, the callback URL will be called and you can then request user data using our SDK. This flow is currently in demo mode with improvements to come in the coming months.

### Going through the example - A. Mobile Flow

You are able to switch between the different user flows by either calling `getAppURL` (mobile flow) or `getWebURL` (guest consent flow) from the SDK.
1. **Navigate to the example app** - Once you open up the second URL on your phone, you should see a screen that has a button that says `Launch Consent Request`

2. **Provide consent** - If you have the digi.me client installed, you should be able to complete the consent access flow. Click on the `Launch Consent Request` button in the starting page. It should bring up the digi.me client and prompt you for consent. Once the user gives consent, the user should be taken to a new page on the browser which displays `Thank you for your data!`

3. **See data shared** - In the same terminal where you got the URLs for the app, you should now see the data that is shared from the user. This is what the user has given consent to in the previous step. NOTE: At the moment you may see 404 errors when trying to read the files. This is because the files are still being prepared and may not be ready yet. We will add support for retrying using exponential backoff in upcoming releases of the SDK.

### Going through the example - B. Guest Consent Flow

You are able to switch between the different user flows by either calling `getAppURL` (mobile flow) or `getWebURL` (guest consent flow) from the SDK. By default, this example uses the guest consent flow.
1. **Navigate to the example app** - Once you open up the second URL on your phone or laptop, you should see a screen that has a button that says `Launch Consent Request`

2. **Provide consent** - Click on the `Launch Consent Request` button in the starting page. It should bring up digi.me consent page in another browser page. From this flow you should see the contract details, and upon giving consent, the user will need to onboard different services to provide the data that can be passed back to the example application. Once the services are onboarded, there will be a slight delay when data is being sync'd to the user personal cloud. When all the data has been collected, the user should be taken to a new page on the browser which displays `Thank you for your data!`

3. **See data shared** - In the same terminal where you got the URLs for the app, you should now see the data that is shared from the user. This is what the user has given consent to in the previous step. NOTE: At the moment you may see 404 errors when trying to read the files. This is because the files are still being prepared and may not be ready yet. We will add support for retrying using exponential backoff in upcoming releases of the SDK.
