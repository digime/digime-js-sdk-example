# digime-js-sdk-example

---
## Preparation
In order to run this example app, you'll need to perform some preparation steps:

#### Obtain the following from digi.me:
* Contract ID
* Application ID
* Private key (PKCS1 PEM)
* Valid iOS/Android client application on your phone, with a library created on it ([See below for more info](#setting-up-the-digi.me-library))

#### On the machine that will run the example:
* Node version 8.6 or greater, with NPM
* git (optional)

## Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/digime/digime-js-sdk-example/archive/sdk.zip) and extract, or clone the `sdk` branch on this repo with the following command:

    `git clone --single-branch -b sdk git@github.com:digime/digime-js-sdk-example.git`

2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned/extracted this example (If you see this README in it, you're in the correct place!)

3. Run `npm install` in your terminal

4. Open the `index.js` file in your favourite code editor, and replace/adjust the placeholders we populated the `APP` variable with the information you received from digi.me.

5. Run `npm start` in your terminal

    This should print out something along these lines:

    ```Example app now running on:
    - http://localhost:8081
    - http://192.168.0.10:8081 (probably)
    ```



6. You should now be able to access the example app ðŸŽ‰:
    - First URL should be able to be opened on the same machine you started the server (So you can be sure it's running)
    - The second URL is our best guess as to what your local network IP is. You should be able to open the example app from your phone with it, assuming that both machines are on the same network.

## Additional information

### Setting up the digi.me library

You need to have an Android or iOS device with the digi.me client installed. Currently, you will need a special build that digi.me will provide. Install the digi.me client and create a library with some data that we can share. If you would like a pre-populated library, you can connect to one of our existing libraries, please contact us for details.

### Going through the example

1. **Navigate to the example app** - Once you open up the second URL on your phone, you should see a screen that has a button that says `Launch Consent Request`

2. **Provide consent** - If you have the digi.me client installed, you should be able to complete the consent access flow. Click on the `Launch Consent Request` button in the starting page. It should bring up the digi.me client and prompt you for consent. Once the user gives consent, the user should be taken to a new page on the browser which displays `Thank you for your data!`

3. **See data shared** - In the same terminal where you got the URLs for the app, you should now see the data that is shared from the user. This is what the user has given consent to in the previous step.
